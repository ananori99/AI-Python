"""
This file contains all of the agents that can be selected to
control Pacman.  To select an agent, use the '-p' option
when running pacman.py.  Arguments can be passed to your agent
using '-a'.  For example, to load a SearchAgent that uses
depth first search (dfs), run the following command:

> python pacman.py -p SearchAgent -a fn=depthFirstSearch

Commands to invoke other search strategies can be found in the
project description.

Please only change the parts of the file you are asked to.
Look for the lines that say

Good luck and happy searching!

    Your heuristic for the FoodSearchProblem goes here.

    This heuristic must be consistent to ensure correctness.  First, try to come up
    with an admissible heuristic; almost all admissible heuristics will be consistent
    as well.

    If using A* ever finds a solution that is worse uniform cost search finds,
    your heuristic is *not* consistent, and probably not admissible!  On the other hand,
    inadmissible or inconsistent heuristics may find optimal solutions, so be careful.

    The state is a tuple ( pacmanPosition, foodGrid ) where foodGrid is a
    Grid (see game.py) of either True or False. You can call foodGrid.asList()
    to get a list of food coordinates instead.

    If you want access to info like walls, capsules, etc., you can query the problem.
    For example, problem.walls gives you a Grid of where the walls are.

    If you want to *store* information to be reused in other calls to the heuristic,
    there is a dictionary called problem.heuristicInfo that you can use. For example,
    if you only want to count the walls once and store that value, try:
      problem.heuristicInfo['wallCount'] = problem.walls.count()
    Subsequent calls to this heuristic can access problem.heuristicInfo['wallCount']
